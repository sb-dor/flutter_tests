The primary difference between setUp and setUpAll in Flutter or Dart test frameworks lies in when they are executed during the testing process and how many times they are executed in a group of tests:

1. setUp()

   •	Runs before each test: The setUp() function is called before each test within a group of tests.
   •	Multiple executions: It executes once before every individual test in the group.
   •	Purpose: Typically used to create or initialize fresh objects or state that will be used in each test. This ensures that each test starts with a clean and isolated environment.
   •	Use case: When you need to reset or re-initialize variables, dependencies, or state for every test to avoid one test affecting another.

        

        setUp(() {
            // Runs before each test
            someResource = SomeResource();
        });
        
        test('first test', () {
            // First test uses the initialized resource
        });
        
        test('second test', () {
            // Second test uses a freshly initialized resource
        });


2. setUpAll()

   •	Runs once before all tests: The setUpAll() function is executed only once before all tests in the group.
   •	Single execution: It runs a single time before any tests in the group are executed, and it does not run again before each test.
   •	Purpose: Typically used for setting up global or shared resources that are expensive to initialize and do not need to be re-created for each test. This can include initializing databases, external services, or shared state that should persist across multiple tests.
   •	Use case: When the setup process is time-consuming or does not need to be repeated for every test (e.g., setting up a database connection).


        setUpAll(() {
            // Runs once before all tests
            someResource = SomeExpensiveResource();
        });
        
        test('first test', () {
            // First test uses the same resource
        });
        
        test('second test', () {
            // Second test uses the same resource
        });



Which to use?

•	Use **setUp()** when each test requires a fresh environment to ensure no test state leaks into another.
•	Use **setUpAll()** when you need to set up shared resources or configurations that can be reused across multiple tests and don’t need resetting between tests.
